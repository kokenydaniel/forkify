## About The Project

Discover the tastiest recipes! With this app you can travel around the world, as you will find more than 1,000,000 recipes from anywhere in the world. Did you like something? Just save it for later so you can find it easily! Got a recipe you can't find but love? Upload it and it will immediately be among the saved. What are you waiting for? Click and discover!

## Built in

1. HTML5
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. Forkify API

## What I learned

I learned a lot about using the API and exposing it. I like challenges like this, like being able to save recipes locally and complexity, so that you can upload a recipe and it will immediately be among the saved and mark with an icon what our own recipe is, and then it will be included in the search results.
It also helped me practice using third-party libraries, like in this project, to display ingredient quantities.

## Acknowledgment

Thanks to everyone who gives feedback on my solution. It definitely helps you find new ways to code and find easier solutions!
